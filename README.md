## Overview
The realm of the computer science industry is ever-changing and constantly evolving. Students constantly need
to learn complex algorithms, difficult coding languages, and new technologies. The demand for proficiency and
mastery in the field is higher than ever, with job markets seeking individuals skilled in the latest advancements.
In this difficult environment, students often lack a source of guidance and mentorship.
ByteBuddies is designed to tackle this very problem. It will act as a way for students to connect to possible
mentors. These mentors possess the expertise and skill to guide students through the labyrinth of academia and
into the competitive job market. Providing this resource for CS students will aid in their knowledge, skills, and
confidence. This product will help foster a community in the computer science field that will continue helping
each new generation of CS students.
Both mentee and mentor will benefit from this. The mentee has someone who can guide them through their
homework, course planning, and overall academic journey. The mentee also has someone who can identify
their weak areas and provide suggestions on how to improve that area. The mentor also greatly benefits from
mentoring someone. By teaching someone what they already know, the mentor is continuing to strengthen their
knowledge. Mentoring someone will help the mentor to gain a truly thorough grasp on their knowledge. After
all, teaching others is the best way to learn
